      I am curious about the world around me and interested in learning new things and exploring new ideas.I am creative and innovative and able to come up with new ideas and solutions to problems. I am independent and self-reliant. I am able to make my own decisions and take care of themselves. I am mostly adaptable and resilient and able to adjust to new situations and overcome challenges.
